*/
/*
when to use which?
1.Sequence containers
>vector->Random Access is fast
         in Middle Insertion/deletion is slow
         in end Insertion/deletion at the end is fast
>list->Random Access is slow
       insertion/deletion in middle is fast
       insertion/deletion in end is fast

2.Associative containers
    All operations is fast except random access

3.Derived containers
    depends->data structure
